Before I explain how and why I started to learn about software development, I probably should introduce myself. Hi, I'm Richard. I'm 5 feet and 10 inches with black hair and brown eyes. I probably don't look like much of a programmer but now I'm learning on programming through flatiron school's online web development program. I have a Bachelor's degree in Microbiology but that has proven to be almost futile and yes I went to college to earn this. Initially, during the start of college, I declared a Bachelor's degree computer science but then I failed cmpsci 187 course after I aced cmpsci 121 course. I switched majors at the end of second year. I went on to work for restaurant service jobs, accounting intern position, warehouse related jobs, and house improvement/renovation jobs. I currently lightly do house-flipping job; I quit my warehouse job(for about 2 years after college graduation) about 3 months ago.And hopefully I continue to do software development.

One reason I wanted to start to connect to software development is to be around technology. I believe technology has the potential to become something of great importance. Technology always seems to grow leaps and bounds, for at least now. At first I did not connect to idea of computers as it was very slow to navigate the internet or even learn about computers. But as time grows, computers become my source of information, mailing, financing, gaming, and connecting to others quicker than someone can holler out an answer. 

A second reason is the versatile of software development. Software development can make an impact on communication/social network, finance, running machines/robots, and pretty much anything. Anything! All someone has to do is come up with a program. Computers are just efficient machines with seemingless capabilities beyond human sometimes. Calculations are perfect and repetitive with probably perfect accuracy.

Another reason of software development is to finish what I should have learned. In a way I was a quitter when I failed cmpsci 187. I quitted because it was hard and then I regretted. I should not finish in regret and probably would have been more been in a more difficult situation had I not started to code last year(2016) and learn the ways of software development and computers. Anyway, cheers to code.
