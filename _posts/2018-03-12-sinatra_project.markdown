I'm excited that I completed my sinatra project. It was hard. But I am really glad. After weeks of tweaking and applying what I learned, my personal-items app is mostly finished. The app isn't much but creates the user logins and signouts perfectly and properly gives the users a list of their created personal items. I manage to use b-crypt and authentication correctly. The big idea about CRUD works for the most part although some more human-friendly interaction could be applied.

The most important aspect about sinatra is that I develop knowledge of how get and post requests work. The another thing is to tie this to the database. Or more accurately creating the MVC(models,views,controllers). The whole process requires routes and CRUD actions. In the future, I can see why CRUD holds a big part of us.
