   Program challenges often ask fundamentals on computer science, stacks, queues, classes, algorithms, and the like sort. The problems are to intended to guage someone’s ability to think critically and provide a strategic programming answer. A lot of times they ask the answer to be efficient in both runtime and space time complexity. In big companies such as Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Apple, when hiring, they most certainly have program challenges for applicants to do. While those companies display all different products, getting recruited in these firms may pose as a challenge. 
	 
After graduating from Flatiron School, I have had some programming challenges and some were difficult and others test a couple of class functions on strings, arrays, and hashes. The programming language that you use does not matter too much but typically, I’ve seen jobs posted for Java, C, C++, Python, and PHP. Each language has its own limitations and have some better methods when creating a solution but all in all, each language still carry the same amount of data types and similar functions. 

Let’s take a look at a programming problem that I found off a website. (You can find the problem here: [http://www.java67.com/2013/11/how-to-count-vowels-and-consonants-in-Java-String-word.html](http://www.java67.com/2013/11/how-to-count-vowels-and-consonants-in-Java-String-word.html).)

How to count Vowels and Consonants in Java String Word

You need to write a Java program to count how many vowels in a String, which is entered from the command prompt. It's similar to the program of counting the occurrence of characters in a String, in fact, it's a special case, where you need to count occurrences of all vowels, which includes five characters a, e, i, o and u.

For our sake, let’s just create the program in any language. 



Here is my answer in Javascript:

The runtime complexity of this solution is O(n*m) , m is for the switch statement. 





Back to solution on the website:

The Java solution is the same and the runtime complexity is O(n*m), m is for the switch statement.


There are a number of websites that have coding problems: LeetCode, HackerRank, CodeWars, and Project Euler. It is probably best to stick to one site as the tools and environment differ in each website. All these websites contain an enormous amount of programming challenges and learning potential. Well, to become fine programmer, it is time for another coding/programming challenge.
