What is responsive layout? It is a format to create readable, detailed, and colorful content on all the different types of screens out there in the world. Screens can come in varying sizes, whether as a computer, tablet, or phone. When web developers create a web page, the web page has a defined set of margin, padding, content-width, and etc. Because this hypothethical web page is viewed differently on the phone's than on the computer's, web developers develop a responsive layout  so viewers can access and enjoy the content without too much difficulty. It is thus a web developer's job to create an important responsive layout for content on any screen that an user possesses.
