Ruby is described as a pure object oriented programming. It is a way to format objects in an elegant manner to create objects in programming. It means strings, boolean values, integers, and floats are objects. And even classes are objects. I guess you can say that everything is an object in the ruby language. In a way, you can look at a class as a container that keeps everything object with its defined methods and properties. 

It would be cool to create objects that stand alone but wouldn't it be cooler to have different objects in a such a sophifisicated manner and maybe create a workable program. Well, with the help of superclasses and modules, this can be possible. The idea and basis of this is a mixin, in which defined methods, classes, and even other modules can come together to share capabilites. Naturally, this may rid of repetivtive code and produce a cleaner, interactive result.

The idea of object orientation was somewhat new to me. I heard this term used in Java but never really dove into the details of it. Object orientation is a way to facilitate a program.
